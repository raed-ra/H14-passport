//express.urlencoded() is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as strings or arrays.

// in the options we can use {store:  sessionStoreObj - which contains info on to connect to database  also can add 
//collection: "session" - than is the collection name where session info is saved}  so in conclusion we are telling the 
//server that we want to use our database to store session info
// to store session data instead of this program using it on server memory
//secret will be saved in environment variables and wont be shown to user
//basically saying if secret is invalid the session is invalid
// when a request is sent, session ID is created and the session ID will be passed by cookie
// resave & saveUninitialized tells server/middleware what to do and how to react if nothing has changed and etc..
// we can add:  cookie: { maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 } equals to 1 day
// so what will happen is that when we send a get request, the middleware is going to create a session
// and take that sessionID and set the cookie equal to session ID then the cookie will be put in the "http header"
// which will be the response header and brower will receive it and save it and from then onwards every request will 
// sent with that cookie.
