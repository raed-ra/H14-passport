    When does a website require a Privacy Policy ?
    
    
    
    When you store or ask for user’s personal information like name, phone, address, email id.
    
    When you store cookie in user’s browser.
    
    When you display advertises that stores cookies in user’s browser. (e.g. AdSense Dart Cookies)
    
    When you have many external links.
    
    
    What to include in Privacy Policy ?
    
    
    
    Be clear on cookie storing.
    
    Be clear on sharing of user personal information. If you have permanent tie up with any third party for the user data mention that. (e.g. We share data with xyz survey company which does survey for our company OR we share our data with xyz company which is parent company of our company.)
    
    Be clear on what type of advertising you display. Warn user about redirecting to third party advertiser sites whose content is out of your control.
    
    If your website deals with user personal data (user’s uploads/social activity) be clear on your action in case of crime investigation. (e.g. Though we don’t share any of your data, unless it’s permitted by you, but in case of legal action we will support official authorities as much as we can in investigation by providing information required. )
